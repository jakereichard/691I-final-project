##Figure 1. The mean coral cover percentages as a function of latitude.  The blue line represents the predicted coral cover between 2010-2020. The orange line represents the predicted coral cover between 2090-2100. The predictions were made using 12 different simulations at around 52,000 sites. The means for all the simulations were calculated and plotted over latitude.     

##Figure 2.The mean coral cover percentages as a function of pH. The left plot represents the predicted coral cover between 2010-2020. The right plot represents the predicted coral cover between 2090-2100. The predictions were made using 12 different simulations at around 52,000 sites. The models also generated the expected pH values at each site. The coral cover was plotted along the pH values to see if there was a trend associated with pH and coral cover. The plots show that the pH levels in 2010-2020 are higher than in 2090-2100. There are also higher coral cover predictions in 2010-2020 than in 2090-2100. 

##Figure 3.The mean coral cover percentages as a function of seasonal Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The seasonal SST was calculated by finding the difference in the predicted SST in the summer and winter seasons. The left plot represents the predicted coral cover between 2010-2020. The right plot represents the predicted coral cover between 2090-2100. The predictions were made using 12 different simulations at around 52,000 sites.
